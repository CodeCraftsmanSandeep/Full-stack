### Notes
#### HTML

- Attributes
    - ```src``` is attribute in ```<img src = '...'>```
- Anchor tag
    - ```<a> <\a>```
    - To hyperlink (or) link to other section of same page
- Headings like h1, h2 .. h6 are only meant for styling but also it gives a sense of organisation of the content to browsers (or) applications that looking at html. (Hirarchy)
    - Ofcourse we can change how headings look using custom CSS
- Whitespace collapsing
    - you may add lot of white spaces in your code, but that all will not be displayed after rendering the html
    - you will have to use tags
- Elements
    - inline elements: not creating a new line (like ```em```, ```strong```)
    - block level elements: like ```h1``` (or) ```p```, they give line breaks
- We can ofcourse customize images using CSS, but now a days it is recommended practise to include width and height info in html because the browser will be able to use this info.
- You can use placeholder images when developing HTML code: https://placehold.co/
- Semantic:
    - Semantic HTML refers to using HTML tags that convey meaning about the content both to the browser and to humans (developers, screen readers, SEO). Use semantic elements as much as possible
        -  ```main```
        - ```header```
        - ```section```
        - ```article```
    - The following have no semantic meaning in html
        - ```<div>```
        - ```<span>```
        - ```<b>```
        - ```<i>```
        - ```<br>```
- forms:
    - **form validation:** checking whether the input entered is valid or not
    -

| ``` <address> <\address> ``` | Address |
| ``` <abbr> <\abbr> ``` | Abbrevation |
| - ordered lists ```<ol> <\ol>``` <br> - unordered lists ```<ul> <\ul>``` <br> - descriptive lists ```<dl> <\dl>``` | Lists |
| Referencing (or) Linking | We will have two types: i) relative ii) absolute <br> We can link to external links (or) files on same server (or) to content in same page (basically internal link)|
| ```<nav> </nav>``` | Navigation bar |
| ```<img>``` | Image (lazy (or) eager loading) |
| ```figure``` | |
| ```header``` | Top section of a page or article |
| ```main``` | main content area |
| ```<time> </time>``` | |
| ```<time> </time>``` | Time semantic meaning |
| ```<form> </form>``` | Form stuff |
