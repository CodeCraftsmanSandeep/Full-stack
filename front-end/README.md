### Notes
#### HTML
- Tags
    - Opening tag
    - Closing tag
- Elements
    - Container elements (like ```<h1> <\h1>```)
    - Standalone elements (like ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, ```<input>```)
- Attributes
    - ```src``` is attribute in ```<img src = '...'>```
- Anchor tag
    - ```<a> <\a>```
    - To hyperlink (or) link to other section of same page
- Headings like h1, h2 .. h6 are only meant for styling but also it gives a sense of organisation of the content to browsers (or) applications that looking at html
    - Ofcourse we can change how headings look using custom CSS
- Whitespace collapsing
    - you may add lot of white spaces in your code, but that all will not be displayed after rendering the html
    - you will have to use tags
- Elements
    - inline elements: not creating a new line (like ```em```, ```strong```)
    - block level elements: like ```h1``` (or) ```p```, they give line breaks
